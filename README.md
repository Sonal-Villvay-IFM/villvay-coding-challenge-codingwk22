**The method used to solve the algorithm(algorithm and Data Structure if you have used any)**
Data structures used are DTOs (Data transfer objects), List Arrays, Object Arrays have been used. External Libraries were taken use of such as iTextPFD. General approach in solving the problem with OOP concepts.

**The order of growth of your algorithm, how does your algorithm perform if you have considered performance.**
Used Lombok, and Java 8 Stream APIs to enhance performance when traversing through lists. Scalability considered by mantaining external .csv files for data input to handle more data.
